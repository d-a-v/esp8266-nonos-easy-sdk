# nonos-easy-sdk

The purpose of this project is to provide an all-in-one build and test
environment for the espressif's esp8266 esp-nonos-sdk firmware, especially
with its v3.

The final goal is simply to be able to blink the internal led, and display
"Hello world" on the serial port (115200/8n1).

That, in the most easy way by just setting the led gpio, the flash size, and
the 'make flash' command.

* The compiler is built from the esp-open-sdk project
* The flasher is espressif's official esptool.py
* The firmware is esp-nonos-sdk v3

# Current status

*builds nonos-sdk examples only (ota / non-ota)*

# Use it

clone this repository, then
```
$ edit makefile.configureme
$ make
$ ./builds/IoT_Demo/minicom+flashme
```

Everything should download, build (including all SDK examples).

In every example directory, flash and log scripts are built,
and serial data will be stored into `output.txt` when run with `minicom` or `screen`.

To exit from `minicom`: `^A ^X (yes)`

To exit from `screen`: `^A k (yes)`
